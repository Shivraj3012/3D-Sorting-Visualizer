I built a web-based 3D Sorting Visualizer using C++ for backend sorting logic and Three.js for frontend 3D rendering. The system converts sorting algorithm operations into animation steps that visually demonstrate comparisons and swaps in real time. Each array element is represented as a 3D cube whose height corresponds to its value. The project supports multiple algorithms and includes interactive controls and performance metrics
